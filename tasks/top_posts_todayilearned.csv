"TIL: To become King Louis XV's official mistress, Madame du Barry had a fake birth certificate made to hide her humble origin as the illegitimate daughter of a seamstress. The birth certificate claimed her family were nobility and that she was 3 years younger than her actual age.",5745,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_du_Barry,Ill_Definition8074,The 3 years younger thing is weird because Louis was 34 years older than Du Barry.

"TIL in 2022, a dispute between Pantone and Adobe resulted in the removal of Pantone color coordinates from Photoshop and Adobe's other design software, causing colors in graphic artists' digital documents to be replaced with black unless artists paid Pantone a separate $15 monthly subscription fee.",20933,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantone,rcreveli,"When I started in Printing back in the 90's Pantone was relatively benign. They were an industry standard without being an official standard. After they were bought by X-Rite things got bad. They kept trying to push new color systems to replace the Pantone Matching System.

The way the PMS system works is that every color can be mixed from a few base colors and each swatch book has the formulas. If you need Pantone 322 for one job you can mix it from stock colors and not buy a whole pound of the Ink. Pantone would love if you had to buy each color through them or an authorized ink manufacturer for every job. This is why ""innovative systems"" like Pantone Go get pushed. It sucks for the printer and raises the costs of a simple job."

TIL that when Terry Fox's famous Marathon of Hope for cancer research entered Quebec he was hampered by locals continuously running him off the road.,8380,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Fox?wprov=sfla1,mantafloppy,"The Wikipedia quote is based on this :

> “June 15, 26 miles, Highway 201,611 miles

> I am tired and weary because people are continually forcing me off the road. I was actually honked off once. People are passing from behind me on this narrow road. It is so frustrating. They all drive at eighty miles per hour and don’t slow down for anything. It is wearisome. Mental breakdown. We talked and ate with John Simpson and Scott Hamilton [filmmakers working on the Cancer Society–sponsored documentary, I Had a Dream] and then I did a long interview. In bed late again.

Terry thought Quebec was beautiful. He admired the statues around the churches, the cobbled streets and the tidy, antiquated shops of old Quebec City. He saw the battlefield on the Plains of Abraham, and it was fun to eat in a restaurant named the Marie Antoinette. He met Gérard Côté, four-time Boston Marathon winner (1940, 1942, 1943, and 1948), and was happy to be featured on the front page of the French-language daily, Le Soleil. That was all very nice, but he wasn’t raising money, running conditions were dangerous, and he wasn’t meeting many people. He believed if the marathon had been better publicized, Quebecers would have responded as other Canadians had.

It was very disappointing; it’s not because they’re French and we’re English. Anyone can get cancer. I’m running across Canada, and Quebec is a province in Canada. With me, it isn’t a political or racial thing, it’s just a human thing. Cancer can strike anybody. I’m trying to help out everybody in my run. In one stretch of Quebec, we collected thirty-five dollars while I ran one hundred miles.

Nor was he helped by the attitude of motorists and the police: “Near Quebec City I kept nearly getting hit because they drove so fast. Afterwards I decided I had to move over to the freeway, which had a side lane. It was perfectly safe and nobody was near me. I ran there for two days when the Quebec Provincial Police told me I couldn’t run on it any more because it wasn’t safe [and because of the traffic expected for the St-Jean-Baptiste holiday weekend]. I had to get back on these other side roads. In Drummondville I got back on the little roads and kept nearly getting hit again. These cars were just whizzing by and shooing me off the road.

“Then Terry learned that he would have to wait in Montreal so he would arrive in Ottawa for Canada Day celebrations, in accordance with the schedule set up by Bill Vigars. He agreed only when Bill told him the difference it might mean in fundraising.

Terry ran into Montreal on a Sunday, using a route he had chosen and mapped out himself. He was accompanied by four wheelchair athletes and former Montreal Alouettes kicker Don Sweet. As he and the others ran down the quiet morning streets, there were few passersby to cheer him on.

...

Once he was on the road again, Terry was dodging cars that zoomed past him at furious speeds. He ran looking over his shoulder. The temperature soared to thirty-two degrees Celsius. The boys started counting the days until they could leave Quebec and the isolation caused by their language difficulties."
